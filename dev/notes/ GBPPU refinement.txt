Overall, Threading the PPU didn't really help because both fork and pthread was too slow to start up.
not giving me enough performance. but I did improve my drawing function still.

It could possibly still be improved by starting up threads in the init function and using "Condition Variables" 
to tell them when to run. But that'll be tested later.
